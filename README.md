## About 'Our Score'
Each score has a different format. RT is %, IMDb is a value between 1-10, and Metacritic is a value between 1-100. In order to calculate the 'Our Score', each one of these scores is converted into the 1-100 format. If one of the scores are not available, then the average is calculated based on the other scores left.
